        "QUESTION": "How long does an air conditioning installation take in Szeged?",
        "ANSWER": "A complete air conditioning installation in Szeged usually takes one day from the on-site survey to the test run, so you can enjoy quiet and efficient cooling right away."
      },
      "MAINTENANCE": {
        "QUESTION": "What maintenance does an air conditioning system need?",
        "ANSWER": "Have your air conditioning system checked at least once a year: clean the heat exchangers, verify the refrigerant level, and calibrate the electronics to avoid faults and reduce energy use."
      },
      "PANEL": {
        "QUESTION": "How do I choose an air conditioner for a Szeged apartment block?",
        "ANSWER": "For Szeged panel apartments, accurate capacity, low indoor noise, and safe condensate drainage are essential. Our on-site survey helps you pick the ideal unit."
      },
      "PERMITS": {
        "QUESTION": "Do I need permits for AC installation in Szeged?",
        "ANSWER": "In condominiums you should ask the building manager for approval, while in detached houses notifying neighbors is recommended. Licensed technicians handle the entire air conditioning installation."
      },
      "PRICE": {
        "QUESTION": "How much does an air conditioning installation cost in Szeged?",
        "ANSWER": "The price of an air conditioning installation in Szeged depends on the chosen type, capacity, and complexity of the work. After a free on-site survey, we provide a detailed, personalized quote that includes material costs and labor."

      "ENERGY": {
        "QUESTION": "How energy-efficient is a modern air conditioning system?",
        "ANSWER": "Today's air conditioning systems are A+++ energy rated, which can mean 40-50% lower energy consumption compared to older systems. We calculate the exact payback period during the on-site survey."

      "HEATING": {
        "QUESTION": "Can I use my air conditioning for heating in winter?",
